Work Day Scheduler
Project Overview
The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The main goal of this application is to help users manage their time effectively by allowing them to plan their day in detail.

The application has several features to support this. Firstly, it displays the current day at the top of the calendar, helping users keep track of the current date. The calendar consists of time blocks that run from 9AM to 5PM. Each time block dynamically shows whether it's in the past, present, or future, aiding in temporal context.

Users can click into a time block to enter a calendar event they want to remember. After entering their event, users can click the save button on the right of the time block to save the event. Upon saving, a pleasant animation plays to indicate that the event has been saved.

Moreover, the application has persistent memory. If a user were to refresh the page, or close it, their events would be preserved. Upon reopening the application, users will be presented with any events that they previously saved​1​.
